# Introduction

Saving money is a very basic principle of personal finance everyone should follow to be safe for any unexpected events. However, investing money is even better. 

Inflation causes our money's buying power to decrease year after year, and the money we keep in our bank accounts does not grow over time, even when we have it saved up in a interest-based savings account, the annual percentage yield is usually lower that 1%, which means even though we have money saved up, we won't be able to afford the same things with it in the future.
This is why is important to, not only save money, but invest it so that its value not only holds up to inflation, but even increases, and allows us to be ready for emergencies and even retirement. There are many ways to invest money in, however, this post will talk about investing in the stock market. 

## How to invest

A good rule of thumb is to invest in the S&P 500 index, which represents 500 of the biggest companies in the U.S. Investing in this index, has historically yielded returns of around 10% annually. However, it is also possible to invest in the individual companies in this index, some of which, have yielded up to 30% or even 50% annually.


## Lets look at the data

I used the S%P 500 data found in the Stock Market MBA and Liberated Stock Trader websites. In this post, I explain how I used the pandas to get the data.

The purpose of this post is to collect the data from the companies in the S&P 500, and look at indicators such market cap, number of employees, priece to earnings ratio, etc. in order to see if there are correlations that can allow us to see what individual companies would be good to invest in.

A later post will perform EDA to figure out if there are individual companies worth investing in.

# Data Collection

I used Python and the Requests package to perform get requests directly to the websites.

# Step 1: Create requests from websites

1. Import the requests package

```
import requests
```


2. Assign websites' urls to variables and perform request

```
url = "https://www.liberatedstocktrader.com/sp-500-companies-list-by-number-of-employees/"
url3 = "https://stockmarketmba.com/stocksinthesp500.php"

r = requests.get(url).content
r3 = requests.get(url3).content
```
