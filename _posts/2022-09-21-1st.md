# How to use Data Science to grow on Social Media

**Have you met people trying to grow their social media audience?**
**You have a very valuable skillset to help them through the power of data science!**


There is no question that social media has become a very powerful tool for business. From individuals to companies and non-profit organizations, having a large audience on social media has an enormous impact when it comes to promoting products, services and good causes. However, most people and organizations struggle to grow their following, which can lead them to give it up.  From posting time, to elements in the images of a video, and captions, there are so many factors and variables that affect the reach a social media post or account can have. But isn't that what we do as data scientists? We work with data to find patterns, correlation, and even predict stuff! You can probably see where this is going. By gathering, cleaning, and analyzing social media data, we can provide very valuable insights for individuals and organizations to implement and help them grow their social media audiences.

The objective of this post is to give an overview of how the data science process works for social media. There is a lot of information to learn on this subject, so I will provide links to resources to learn more about it.


##Collecting data

The first step in this process is to collect data. This step is key in being able to find insights related to Social media. Which is the main focus of this post. 

Most social media platforms have analytics tools that provide useful information. However, sometimes the way data is being presented is limited. This is why it is useful to sign up for developer accounts, that allow us to collect raw data that will be more flexible to handle.

Most social media platforms have these feature, and is very useful. With a little research you can find how to create a developer account to have access to raw data.

The link below is a good resource on creating developer accounts and collecting data on twitter.

**The next steps are known to us already so I will provide a brief summary of them.**



##Cleaning data

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. This is why it is important to clean our data.

We want to really consider in this stage what metrics and indicators are relevant to the social media account we are analyzing, by doing so we simplify our data sets and we are able to look at what is actually important for our case.

The link below provides an overview of how this can be done in python

##EDA

Next we conduct an Exploratory data analysis, which is the process of performing initial investigations on data so in order to discover patterns, to test hypothesis and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

This can already provide valuable insight to our client, it is important to use simple graphic representations that are easy for anyone to understand.

The link below provides an example in python.

##Building and deploying models

This is the main part of the data science process that allows us find relationships between variables and being able to create predictions.

There is a lot of data science lingo in this step, we must try our best to simplify our findings so that our client understands it easily. We must also provide actionable steps to show them how our findings will actually help them improve and grow their audience.

The link below provides an example in python.

##Conclusion

In this post we reviewed briefly how the data science process works, and how we can retrieve data from social media platforms in order to implement this process and help organizations grow their audiences.

This is a long process, and each step has its challenges, however, when we master this, we will be able to provide very valuable skills to our clients.

**Whatâ€™s next?**

A good way to put this into action is to find a social media account of a person or organization you know and care about, sign up for a developer account on the platform of your choice and try this process for them. You can then show them your findings, and possibly even help them. This will help you practice and get good references from the people you helped.

**Good luck!**
