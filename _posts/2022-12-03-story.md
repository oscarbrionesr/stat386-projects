# Introduction

Investing money in good companies can bring us peace of mind for our future.

In my previous post I talked about how to collect the S&P 500 data to perform analysis and looked at some graphics that will help us have a better idea about what the companies in the S&P 500 look like.

Investing in the S&P 500 is generally a good index to invest in because it has yielded 8% - 10% anually. My goal was see if we could be able to find stocks or sectors to invest in that have good returns besides the overall S&P 500.

# Best Dividend Paying Stocks (Data Story):

I was able to create a graphic that shows us the different sectors of the companies in the S&P 500, showing the different annual dividend yields they have.

This is helpful because it can show us which sectors have a better payout. There are obviously other things to consider like the overal performance of the comppany in the past, their market cap, etc. However, being able to look at the dividend payout can be useful to lean towards companies that have a higher one. 

The graphic looks like this:

As we can see, Finance, communications, consumer-non durables, and energy minerals are sectors that have companies with high dividend yields. It would be worth looking into companies in these sectors and see if they are good companies to invest in.
