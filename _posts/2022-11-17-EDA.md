# Introduction

Investing money in good companies can bring us peace of mind for our future.

In my previous post I talked about how to collect the S&P 500 data to perform analysis. In this post, we will look at some graphics that will help us have a better idea about what the companies in the S&P 500 look like.

*Complete code and data can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/oscarbrionesr/sp500-web-scraping).*

# Conclusion

In this post I showed how to collect data from multiple websites to create a custom dataset.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions on this data in the comments below!
