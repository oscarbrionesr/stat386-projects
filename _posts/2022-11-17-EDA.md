# Introduction

Investing money in good companies can bring us peace of mind for our future.

In my previous post I talked about how to collect the S&P 500 data to perform analysis. In this post, we will look at some graphics that will help us have a better idea about what the companies in the S&P 500 look like.

*Complete code and data can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/oscarbrionesr/sp500-web-scraping).*

# Exploring the Data

I wanted to look at different relationships between the data points we have, and see if we can determine what type of companies are good to invest in.

The data set looks like this:

# 1. Employees and Dividend Yield

The plot below shows the relationship between the number of employees (in thousands) in companies and the dividend yield they provide. 
I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the amount of employees in a company and how much they distribute to the stock holders.

As you can see, it seems like the most popular dividend yield is around 1% - 3%, and the companies with this yield have all less than 200,000 employees.

# 2. PE Ratio and Dividend Yield

The plot below shows the relationship between the PE Ratio and the Dividend Yield.

As you can see, it seems like companies with a PE Ratio of around 25 tend to have higher a Dividend Yield.

# 3. Sector and Market Cap

The plot below shows the relationship between the the sector of the companies and the Market Capitalization (in millions). Companies with higher market cap tend to be stronger and more trusted by people, since this number indicates how much money is invested in the company.

As you can see, it seems like companies in the Electronic technology sector have higher market caps.

# 4. Sector and Employees

The plot below shows the relationship between the the sector of the companies and the number of employees (in thousands). A high number of employees can mean greater dificulty in management and fulfillment, wich can lead to more volatility in the the value of the company.

As you can see, it seems like companies in the Retail Trade sector have higher number of employees.

# 5. Sector and Dividend Yield

The plot below shows the relationship between the the sector of the companies and the Dividend Yield.

As you can see, it seems like companies in the communications sector have a higher dividend yield.
