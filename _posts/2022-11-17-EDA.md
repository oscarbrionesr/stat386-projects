# Introduction

Investing money in good companies can bring us peace of mind for our future.

In my previous post I talked about how to collect the S&P 500 data to perform analysis. In this post, we will look at some graphics that will help us have a better idea about what the companies in the S&P 500 look like.

*Complete code and data can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/oscarbrionesr/sp500-web-scraping).*

# Exploring the Data

I wanted to look at different relationships between the data points we have, and see if we can determine what type of companies are good to invest in.

# 1. Employees and Dividend Yield

The plot below shows the relationship between the number of employees in companies and the dividend yield they provide. 
I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the amount of employees in a company and how much they distribute to the stock holders.

As you can see, it seems like the most popular dividend yield is around 1% - 3%, and the companies with this yield have all less than 200,000 employees.

# Conclusion

In this post I showed how to collect data from multiple websites to create a custom dataset. Particularlly, I am interested in looking at number of employees, market cap, dividend yield, PE ratios, and a few more, in order to show in future posts how to analyze and work with this data to find insights on companies worth investing in.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions on this data in the comments below!
