# Introduction

Investing money in good companies can bring us peace of mind for our future.

In my previous post I talked about how to collect the S&P 500 data to perform analysis. In this post, we will look at some graphics that will help us have a better idea about what the companies in the S&P 500 look like.

*Complete code and data can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/oscarbrionesr/sp500-web-scraping).*

# Conclusion

In this post I showed how to collect data from multiple websites to create a custom dataset. Particularlly, I am interested in looking at number of employees, market cap, dividend yield, PE ratios, and a few more, in order to show in future posts how to analyze and work with this data to find insights on companies worth investing in.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions on this data in the comments below!
